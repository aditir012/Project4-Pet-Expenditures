Nearly two-thirds of U.S. households own pets (American Veterinary Medical Association [AVMA], 2019). 
Caring for pets is expensive, and spending recently has snowballed (American Pet Products Association [APPA], 2019). 
Data from the APPA showed that Americans collectively spend around $95.7 billion on pets, and this expenditure is expected to reach $99 billion in 2020. 
Millennials or Generation Y (born 1981-1996) are the largest living generation in America. 
Although they are less likely to be homeowners, car owners, get married, or start a family, millennials lead the generation in pet ownership. 
Lately, there has been an enormous growth in pet ownership and pet spending due to the "humanizing" of pets (Young, 2017) courtesy of the Millennials. 
Psychologists believe that pets replace children for millennials (Bhattarai, 2016). 
This paper analyzes the influence of millennials' pet expenditures on their recreational and social activities expenditures. 
It has been found that spending on pets positively influences the expenditure on other entrainment goods and services. 
The results will be of interest to pet market researchers, social scientists, and family science researchers.
