***An Analysis of Millennial's Expenditure on Pets***

**About the project:**

Nearly two-thirds of U.S. households own pets (American Veterinary Medical Association [AVMA], 2019). 
Caring for pets is expensive, and spending recently has snowballed (American Pet Products Association [APPA], 2019). 
Data from the APPA showed that Americans collectively spend around $95.7 billion on pets, and this expenditure is expected to reach $99 billion in 2020. 
Millennials or Generation Y (born 1981-1996) are the largest living generation in America. 
Although they are less likely to be homeowners, car owners, get married, or start a family, millennials lead the generation in pet ownership. 
Lately, there has been an enormous growth in pet ownership and pet spending due to the "humanizing" of pets (Young, 2017) courtesy of the Millennials. 
Psychologists believe that pets replace children for millennials (Bhattarai, 2016). 
This paper analyzes the influence of millennials' pet expenditures on their recreational and social activities expenditures. 
It has been found that spending on pets positively influences the expenditure on other entrainment goods and services. 
The results will be of interest to pet market researchers, social scientists, and family science researchers.

**About the dataset:**
The data used for this study comes from the interview segment of the Consumer Expenditure (CE) Surveys collected by the Census Bureau for the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS). The Consumer Expenditure Survey is a quarterly panel survey that provides data on a households' expenditure, income, and socio-demographic characteristics. It is the only Federal household survey to provide information on the complete range of consumers' expenditures and incomes. We isolate items pertaining to expenditure on pets (from the entertainment expenditure) to formulate the yearly spending on pets. We consider data for the years 2010 through 2019.
